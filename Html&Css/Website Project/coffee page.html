<h1> All about Coffee </h1>


<blockquote> Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. 
It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.[2][unreliable source?]</blockquote>

<p> The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.
The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. 
It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). 
Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.</p>

<p> Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. 
Even though the origin of coffee drinking is obscure,[3] 
By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. 
In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.</p>

<h2>Basic steps to make perfect coffee</h2>
<p> Grind coffee beans to medium or medium-fine grind size. 
Bring filtered water to a boil, 
then let it sit for a minute.
 Pour enough water into the filter to wet it completely, 
 and let it drain into your cup or coffee pot. Discard the water.</P>
