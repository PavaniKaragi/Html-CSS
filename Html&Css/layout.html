	<h1>Heading 1</h1>
	<p> paragraph 1- violin, byname fiddle, bowed stringed musical instrument that evolved during the Renaissance from earlier bowed instruments: 
	the medieval fiddle; its 16th-century Italian offshoot, the lira da braccio; and the rebec. 
	The violin is probably the best known and most widely distributed musical instrument in the world.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="block2">
	<h1>Heading 2</h1>
	<p> paragraph 2- Like its predecessors but unlike its cousin the violin, 
	the violin has a fretless fingerboard. 
	Its strings are hitched to tuning pegs and to a tailpiece passing over a bridge held in place by the pressure of the strings.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="block3">
	<h1>Heading 3</h1>
	<p> paragraph 3- The belly is supported from beneath by the bass bar, a narrow wood bar running lengthwise and tapering into the belly. 
	It also contributes to the resonance of the instrument.
	The sidewalls, or ribs, are constructed of pine-lined maple.</p>
